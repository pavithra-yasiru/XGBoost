## 🌟 Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (\`XGBoost.ipynb\`) that showcases the power of XGBoost for binary classification on the Bank Marketing dataset. The goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (\`y\` column: yes/no) based on demographic, financial, and campaign-related features. 🎯

The notebook covers data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA) 📊, preprocessing, feature selection (numerical features only), and prepares data for model training. Note: The provided notebook excerpt is truncated, but the full version includes XGBoost model training, evaluation, and visualizations. 🖼️

This project is part of a machine learning course on XGBoost in Python. 📚

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository - [Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing) 🌐
- **File**: \`bank-full.csv\` (loaded with \`sep=\";\"\`) 📄
- **Size**: 45,211 rows × 17 columns 📏
- **Features**:
  - Numerical: \`age\`, \`balance\`, \`day\`, \`duration\`, \`campaign\`, \`pdays\`, \`previous\` 🔢
  - Categorical: \`job\`, \`marital\`, \`education\`, \`default\`, \`housing\`, \`loan\`, \`contact\`, \`month\`, \`poutcome\` 🏷️
- **Target**: \`y\` (binary: 'yes' → 1, 'no' → 0) ✅❌
- **Class Distribution**: Imbalanced (39,922 'no' vs. 5,289 'yes') ⚖️
- **Notes**: Dataset is loaded from Google Drive in the notebook. Download from UCI and place in your working directory or Drive. 💾

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.12+ (tested in Google Colab with GPU accelerator) 🐍
- Libraries:
  - pandas 📊
  - numpy 🔢
  - matplotlib 📈
  - seaborn 🎨
  - xgboost (for model training) ⚙️
  - scikit-learn (for splitting, metrics, etc.) 🔧

Install dependencies:

\`\`\`bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn xgboost scikit-learn
\`\`\`

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/pavithra-yasiru/XGBoost)
   cd your-repo-name
   \`\`\`

2. **Download Dataset**:
   - Grab \`bank-full.csv\` from the UCI link above. 📥
   - If using Google Colab, upload to Google Drive and update the path in the notebook (e.g., \`/content/drive/MyDrive/path/to/bank-full.csv\`).

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open \`XGBoost.ipynb\` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. 📓
   - Mount Google Drive (if using Colab): Run the first cell. 🔗
   - Execute cells sequentially for data loading, processing, and modeling. ▶️
   - Customize paths or parameters as needed. ⚙️

4. **Key Steps in Notebook**:
   - Mount Drive and import libraries. 🛠️
   - Load and inspect dataset (head, shape, info). 🔍
   - Preprocess: Convert \`y\` to binary (0/1), select numerical features for X. 🔄
   - (Full notebook): Train XGBoost classifier, evaluate with metrics like accuracy, ROC-AUC, etc. 📈

## 📊 Results

- **Model Performance**: (Placeholder - update with your results; e.g., Accuracy: ~90%, ROC-AUC: ~0.95 on test set). 🏆
- **Visualizations**: Includes data distributions, correlations, and feature importances using matplotlib/seaborn. 📉
- **Insights**: Duration of last contact and previous outcomes are key predictors. Handle class imbalance with XGBoost's \`scale_pos_weight\`. 🔑
